Hi, I am yuvicc and today we'll go through building bitcoin core in detail.

Bitcoin Core is a full node implementation of the Bitcoin protocol. It allows users to participate in the Bitcoin network by validating transactions and blocks, and by providing a wallet for storing and sending Bitcoin.

To run Bitcoin Core, you will need to download the latest version of the software from the official website. Once downloaded, you can run the software by double-clicking on the executable file.

Once Bitcoin Core is running, you can use it to send and receive Bitcoin, as well as to view your transaction history and balance. You can also use Bitcoin Core to create and manage your own Bitcoin addresses.
